description: An overview of public testnets that you can test Ocean Protocol applications against.
---

You can test an Ocean Protocol application (such as a marketplace) against some testnets that are maintained by the Ocean Protocol Foundation and others.

## Kovan Testnet

The [Kovan Testnet](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) (or just "Kovan") is a public Ethereum testnet operated by members of the Ethereum community. The Ocean Protocol [keeper contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) (smart contracts) are deployed there.

Moreover, there is a [Secret Store](/concepts/components/#secret-store) operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation which is connected to the Kovan Testnet: the Ocean Secret Store for Kovan.

## Ocean Testnet

The Ocean Testnet (also called the Ocean POA Testnet) is similar to the Kovan Testnet, except all the nodes are operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation. The Ocean Protocol [keeper contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) (smart contracts) are deployed there.

Moreover, there is a [Secret Store](/concepts/components/#secret-store) operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation which is connected to the Ocean Testnet: the Ocean Secret Store.
