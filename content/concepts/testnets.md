description: An overview of public testnets that you can test Ocean Protocol applications against.
---

You can test an Ocean Protocol application (such as a marketplace) against some testnets that are maintained by the Ocean Protocol Foundation and others.

## Kovan Testnet

The [Kovan Testnet](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) (or just "Kovan") is a public Ethereum testnet operated by members of the Ethereum community. The Ocean Protocol [keeper contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) (smart contracts) are deployed there.

Moreover, there is a [Secret Store](/concepts/components/#secret-store) operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation which is connected to the Kovan Testnet: the Ocean Secret Store for Kovan.

To use those for testing your application, you need:

1. A Kovan address, i.e. an address for a wallet that can hold Kovan Ether.
1. Kovan Ether (KEth).
1. Kovan Ocean Tokens.
1. Information about how to connect to Kovan and the Ocean Secret Store for Kovan.

See [the tutorials section](/tutorials/introduction/) for help with getting all that.

## Ocean Testnet

The Ocean Testnet is similar to the Kovan Testnet, except all the nodes are operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation. The Ocean Protocol [keeper contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) (smart contracts) are deployed there.

Moreover, there is a [Secret Store](/concepts/components/#secret-store) operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation which is connected to the Ocean Testnet: the Ocean Secret Store.

To use those for testing your application, you need:

1. An Ocean Testnet address, i.e. an address for a wallet that can hold Ocean Testnet Ether.
1. Ocean Testnet Ether.
1. Ocean Testnet Ocean Tokens.
1. Information about how to connect to the Ocean Testnet and the Ocean Secret Store.
