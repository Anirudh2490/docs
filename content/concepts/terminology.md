There is terminology specific to Ocean Protocol.

## Asset

## Publisher

## Consumer

Someone who wants assets. An example is a data scientist working at an economic think tank.

## Marketplace

A service where publishers can list what assets they have, and consumers can see what's available then buy it (or get it for free).

## Keeper

A computer running a blockchain client (i.e. a blockchain node) where the associated blockchain network is running the Ocean Protocol keeper contracts (smart contracts).

## Aquarius

## Brizo

## Secret Store

## Squid

A set of software libraries to interact with Ocean network participants, including Keepers, Aquarius, Brizo, and Secret Store. The initial libraries are in Python, JavaScript and Java.
