## Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)

Ocean Protocol uses [C4 Standard process](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc/blob/master/1/README.md) to manage changes in the source code. Find more details in the respective [OEP-01](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/1).

## Project management

We use GitHub as a means for maintaining and tracking issues, roadmap and source code development.

-   [Ocean Protocol on GitHub](https://github.com/oceanprotocol)
-   [Business Board (Ocean Roadmap)](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/projects/1)
-   [Milestones](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open)

We use the _dev-ocean_ repository for internal documentation of most of our engineering processes.
