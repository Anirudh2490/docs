Ocean Protocol uses [C4 Standard process](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc/blob/master/1/README.md) to manage changes in the source code. Find more details in the respective [OEP-01](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/1).

We use GitHub as a means for maintaining and tracking issues, roadmap and source code development.
