These tutorials give examples of how to use squid-js (JavaScript) and squid-py (Python) to:

- publish a data set
- publish a compute service
- get and use a data set
- get and use a compute service

The Python tutorials use [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
For now, check out [the Mantaray repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/mantaray). In the future, we hope to have live online Jupyter notebooks.
