title: Wallets for Ocean Tokens
description: If you want to use the Ocean Network, you need Ocean Tokens (typical ERC-20 tokens), and to get Ocean Tokens, you need to get a wallet that can hold Ocean Tokens.

## Some Terminology

There's a lot of terminology around wallets, so we'll start by going over some of it.

A wallet might contain only one **account** (Ethereum account) or it might contain many accounts.

Each account has a **balance** (e.g. 1.832 Ocean Tokens), an **address** (e.g. 0xa0A9d7e78bF29351997cA5589A0Af689eEC99211), a **public key** and a **private key**.

An account is identified by its address, so if you want someone to send some Ocean Tokens to a specific account, you give them the account's address.

The private key is used to spend the Ocean Tokens in the account. You must keep it secret, because anyone with that private key can spend those tokens. If you lose the secret key, and nobody else has it, then _nobody_ can spend those tokens, so don't lose it!

> Note: The same account might have an Ocean Token balance, an [Ether](https://www.ethereum.org/ether) balance, and other balances.

## Wallet Options

Ocean Tokens are [ERC-20 tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20), so any wallet that supports arbitrary ERC-20 tokens should work to hold Ocean Tokens.

There are many kinds of wallets (e.g. paper wallets, hardware wallets, software wallets, custodial wallets), each with its own advantages and disadvantages. There is a tradeoff between security and convenience. We encourage you to search around and read about wallets to understand the options.

**We don't recommend or endorse any particular wallets at this time.** Some wallets which _might_ work with Ocean Tokens are:

- Gnosis Safe
- MetaMask
- Trust Wallet
- Tokenary
