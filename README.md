## Content

All content lives in the [`/content`](content/) & [`/data`](data/) folders utilizing GitHub Flavored Markdown and YAML. Content is organized into the above mentioned categories through subfolders. Those subfolder names, along with the file name, define the final url of a given piece of content.

The final navigational organisation of the content is driven through the sidebar files under [`/data/sidebars`](data/sidebars/).

Have a look at [docs.oceanprotocol.com/test/](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/test/) to see what content elements can be used in the docs.

### Sections

The documentation is split in multiple sections whose content lives in this repo:

-   Core concepts: high-level explanation of concepts, assumptions, and components
-   Setup: getting started for various stakeholders and use cases
-   Tutorials: detailed tutorials

Those sections and their copy are defined in the [`/data/sections.yml`](data/sections.yml) file.

TODO: Additionally, these docs live in their respective repos and are pulled into this site on build time:

-   API reference
-   Component docs

### Editing docs

Every article on [docs.oceanprotocol.com](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com) ends with an _Edit this page on GitHub_ link. Clicking that will put you to the right place in the repository from where you can hit the _Edit_ pencil icon.

GitHub will automatically fork the repository if you are not part of the `oceanprotocol` organisation on GitHub. Members can simply push to a new branch on the original repo.

The editing workflow is as follows:

1. Make your changes
2. Push your changes to a new branch in the repo, or in your fork
3. Open a pull request against `master`, automatically asking for review
4. Wait for review, possibly make request changes
5. Wait for all checks to pass
6. Merge!

### Adding docs

### Repositories

The repositories list is currently sourced from the [`/data/repositories.yml`](data/repositories.yml) file. The GitHub link is auto generated from the given repository name and will always be added by default.

-   [`/data/repositories.yml`](data/repositories.yml)

## Development

The site is a React app built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), pulling its content from various sources.

As a prerequisite you'll need on your machine:

-   Node.js
-   npm

Clone this repo, install all dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docs.git
cd docs/

npm i
npm start
```

This will start a hot-reloading local server exposed under [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Use Docker

Alternatively, you can use Docker for which you need to have installed on your machine:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Then use Compose to bring everything up:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will expose a hot-reloading server under [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
